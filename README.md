Nitesh Synergy (Nitesh) is building an AI platform that flattens the organizational hierarchy. The system will operate with only a few essential roles: Developer, QA, CEO, and a single Controller who serves as the bridge between the CEO and the Tech Lead.

We are eliminating positions such as Senior Manager, Manager, Agile Manager, and similar roles, because their responsibilities can be taken over by NiteshSynergy.ai.

Our next project focuses on reducing wasted AI usage: we want to apply AI for true innovation and realâ€‘time work, not just for minor, isolated tasks.
